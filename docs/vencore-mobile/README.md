# Vencore Mobile
## The continuation of Revenge Classic!

### FAQ
Q: How do I download it?

A: Check [here](https://github.com/ApexTeamPL/venmobile-bundle)

Q: What are the differences between this and Kettu or Revenge?

A: Vencore is the continuation of Revenge Classic, therefore some bugs may still be here. But we've added built-in plugin browser and some overall improvements to the bundle. We've also set the static stable version in manager to ensure better stability.

Q: What versions does Vencore support? And can I run X version?

A: Vencore was made for version 292014. But it supports versions from 286015 up to 298205. You can always open issue if you have any issues with the app.

Q: Does plugin X will work on Vencore?

A: Vencore uses the same APIs as Vendetta, Revenge, Kettu or Bunny - so yes, if it's made for 292014 or up. We won't support any plugins made below 292014.

Q: Do you have any support channel?

A: Email me at vmuser-plugins-issues.encroach760@aleeas.com
